The simple full stack one page app : "Phonebook", based on the tasks of the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), [Programming a server with NodeJS and Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3).    
I use the app to test how it works on Fly.io and Render. 

At the moment there is only the backend. 

Possible to run it by: 
```
npm run server 
```
from the root of the project.
